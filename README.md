# TIC-TAC-TOE PROJECT


## Description

This is a project on the game Tic-Tac-Toe.

The project is supposed to emulate a PvP version of Tic-Tac-Toe,
with players/users having to input their names.


## Technologies 

Utilized HTML, JavaScript, and CSS


## Challenges

Some of the technical challenges I faced during the project were translating
the game logics into code:

- determining the win conditions for the player
- determining the draw condition 
- how to reset the board while keeping the scores saved


## Future Implementations

- Adding modals for win and draw conditions with messages and a 
  restart button and/or exit button
- Extra game-option: bonus game mode


## Installation

Fork the repo into your repository and have fun
